AWS CLOUD PROJECT
Overview
This project showcases the integration of AWS Route 53 for domain management, Vercel for hosting, and Git for version control. The application is hosted on a remote Git repository and deployed to Vercel using CI/CD processes. Updates to the application can be made locally and pushed to the remote repository, triggering automatic deployment to the Vercel server.

Technologies Used
AWS Route 53
Vercel
Git
Continuous Integration
Continuous Deployment
Setup
AWS Route 53 Configuration:

Create a hosted zone on AWS Route 53.
Set up DNS records to point to the Vercel deployment.
Vercel Deployment:

Create an account on Vercel.
Connect the Vercel account to the Git repository containing the application.
Configure the deployment settings on Vercel to automatically deploy changes from the Git repository.
Git Repository:

Clone the remote Git repository to your local machine.
Make changes to the application locally.
Push changes to the remote repository to trigger automatic deployment to Vercel.
CI/CD Process
Changes made to the application on the local machine are pushed to the remote Git repository.
Vercel detects the changes in the Git repository and automatically triggers a deployment to the Vercel server.
AWS Route 53 DNS records are updated to reflect the changes in the Vercel deployment.
Pros and Best Practices
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Define infrastructure configurations using code (e.g., AWS CloudFormation, Terraform) to automate provisioning and management of resources.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging solutions (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Vercel logs) to track application performance and troubleshoot issues.
Security: Follow security best practices (e.g., IAM policies, SSL/TLS certificates) to protect data and infrastructure from potential threats.
Scalability: Design the architecture to be scalable and resilient to handle varying levels of traffic and demand.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of AWS, Vercel, and Git in a CI/CD pipeline for hosting and deploying applications. By leveraging these tools and following best practices, developers can efficiently manage and deploy their projects, showcasing their skills and expertise in DevOps practices.
